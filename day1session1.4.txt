1. the characteristics of Big data in detail.

* Volume -the size of data.
* Velocity-the speed at which the data is generated.
* Variety-the different types of data.
* Veracity-the trustworthiness of the data in terms of accuracy.
* Value-just having bigdata is no use unless we can turn it into values.
 
2. the possible solutions to handle Big data.

Scaleup- Increase the configuration of a single system
 scale out-Use multiple commodity machines and distribute the load of
storage/processing among them

3.the differences between scaling up and scaling out

Scale Up
• Increase the configuration of a single system
• Like disk capacity, RAM, data transfer speed
• Complex, costly, and time consuming process

 Scale Out
• Use multiple commodity (economical) machines and distribute the load of
storage/processing among them
• Economical and quick to implement as it focuses on distribution of load
• Instead of having a single system with 10 TB of storage and 80 GB of RAM,
use 40 machines with 256 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM
